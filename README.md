# Stock Sentinel Next

This was originally a Laravel project and you can find that repo in my profile. I wanted to try a different approach to showing the data leveraging Next.js caching mechanisms. I originally was going to also set up a Graphql endpoint but I am finding it doesn't play very nice with the new App router in next.js 13, and I already have a great tool in mongoclient.
